## Evoke TKM 2019

My first ever Hackathon experience was at TKM. My friends and I on a whim took a train and went there to see what a "hackathon" is. We had a lot of fun on those 2 days. It was on 2nd February, 2019. A 24 hour hackathon and we were surprised and excited to hear our victory and about the internship offers provided.
